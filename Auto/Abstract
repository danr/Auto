First steps in Automated Induction in Agda

After Moa's talk last week about induction, I did an attempt on
writing an automated induction solver in Agda, for the theory of
natural numbers. It does induction on one variable and instantiates
user-specified lemmas. If it gets stuck it will report the current
state to the user. The set of functions is extendable, the user can
choose unary and binary operators over natural numbers provided that
the normalisation functions are supplied.

I will show a demo of the inductive prover in action, and discuss
future work which includes using stronger rewriting techniques like
rippling and adding induction over other datatypes than natural
numbers.
